## User Scenarios & Journey Maps

### Jackson's Scenario

#### Why Jackson is using this product

Jackson is about to start his senior year at high school. As such, college prep is very much on his mind, and he is quite nervous about it. He’s the oldest of three siblings, and therefore is the first in his family to go through the college admissions process. On top of that, his family by no means has a lot of money, and his parents want to spread what they can afford to spend on college equally among their kids. So, Jackson is looking for financial aid solutions so that he can attend MIT, the college of his dreams. He aspires to become an engineer and provide for his future kids in a way his parents cannot for him. Adding another dimension to his situation, he works part time to assist his family financially to the extent that he can, so he does not have a lot of free time to search. He wants to find an online resource that can cover as many of his financial aid searches as possible. Plus, he wants to be able to browse his options in an efficient manner, so as to maximize productivity despite his limited free time.

#### How Jackson is using this product

After a long day of school, work, and homework, Jackson is finally able to do some quick financial aid searching at 11:00pm, giving him an hour or so before he goes to sleep. He creates a new tab on his computer and opens FAHub, his one-stop-shop for all of his financial aid needs. In the menu bar, he clicks “Browse,” then “Scholarships,” as that is the topic of his search for today. After his search results load, he toggles the “Only Show Eligible Results” switch, and is pleasantly surprised to see all of the results are ones for which he is eligible and satisfy his needs. This is because FAHub allowed him to create a profile beforehand, where he put information about his demographics, academic performance, and financial aid needs. FAHub used this data to automatically filter the results that suited his needs, so he didn’t need to waste time combing through results that wouldn’t work for him anyway. Looking at the first option, he hovers over it, then clicks the “Quick View” button. Staying on the same page, he is now presented with a variety of high-level information about the scholarship, from the dollar amount it offers to important stipulations for eligibility and deadlines to be aware of. Perusing the first source takes him less than ten minutes, and he is glad to see that he can get a decent amount of searching before bed, which he does.
