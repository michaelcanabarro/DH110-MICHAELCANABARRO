### About the Project 

The highlights of higher education-- lifelong friends, memories, and more-- are often publicized, especially in the digital age, when students' college experiences are often shared on social media platforms. However, behind this glamorous facade, accessibility has been, and still is, one of the greatest issues plaguing higher education. Even in the wake of affirmative action programs over the decades, minority and underrepresented groups still find themselves facing many barriers between them and the esteemed college experience. In this project, I hope to shed light on the issue of accessibility through the lens of user experience in the state of Massachusetts, home to some of the most well-known colleges and universities in the United States. What is the government doing to assist underrepresented groups and make college more accessible to them? Is the government providing information about these programs in a way that makes it easier or more difficult to learn about them? By answering these questions and ones that arise from them, I hope to examine one of many facets in which access to higher edication can be improved.

### Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained
|Number|Heuristic|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|**Visibility of System Status**|The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.|
|2|**Match Between System and the Real World**|The design should be understandable for its users. It should use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. It should follow real-world conventions and present information in a natural and logical order.|
|3|**User Control and Freedom**| In the case that a user performs an action by mistake, the design should provide a clearly-marked "emergency exit" to quickly abandon the unwanted action. |
|4|**Consistency and Standards**| Words and phrases should have consistent meanings across the entire design, following platform and industry conventions where possible. |
|5|**Error Prevention**| The design should carefully prevent problems from occurring, whether through eliminating conditions that lead to errors or making users confirm their choice before completing an action. |
|6|**Recognition Rather than Recall**| The design should minimize the user's cognitive load by making elements, actions, and options easily visible. The design should be such that users do not have to remember information from other parts of the interface in order to use it. This required information should be visible or easy to locate on the design. |
|7|**Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**| The design should include shortcuts usable for expert users, so that it is equally usable for users of all experience levels. It should also allow users to tailor frequent actions. |
|8|**Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**| The interface should only contain information that is relevant or needed often, as every additional piece of information competes with others for user attention and diminishes others' relative visibility. |
|9|**Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**| Error messages should be easily understandable, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. |
|10|**Help and Documentation**| If needed, the design must include documentation to guide users in completing certain tasks.

|Rating|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project|
|2|Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority|
|3|Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority|

## Website 1: [Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority](https://www.mefa.org/)

### About

The Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA) is a Massachusets state organization that aims to provide help at all stages of school planning, with an emphasis on financial planning. They offer plans for all levels of education, from pre-K to graduate school. In terms of financing, they offer resources to create savings plans, learn more about financial aid, and apply for a loan directly from MEFA. 

In my heuristic evaluation, I will focus on the perspective of a student who needs financial aid in order to go to college and is interested in applying for financial aid. From this point of view, ease of use will be crucial, as it could be the difference between applying for a loan-- and ultimately going to college-- or not.
