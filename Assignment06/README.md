## Introduction

In [Assignment 5](https://github.com/michaelcanabarro/DH110-MICHAELCANABARRO/blob/main/Assignment05/README.md), I built the basic structure of my website based on the findings from Assignments 1-4. For this assignment, I will be elaborating on that structure and exploring the more cosmetic features of my website, from button shapes and layouts to font selection. I will also be conducting an impression test with a user to help determine which variation is the most desirable for the people who will be using the website and test it to ensure adherence to accessibility standards. In completing these tasks, I hope to gain an even clearer vision of what the final product will look like thanks to valuable information from user feedback.

## Screen Designs

Below are screenshots of the various screens of my website, according to the wireflows and tasks outlined in [Assignment 5](https://github.com/michaelcanabarro/DH110-MICHAELCANABARRO/blob/main/Assignment05/README.md). Click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/5E9fUXyux4GbmlvOCSaLfL/A06_Digitized_Wireflows?node-id=0%3A1) to access the Figma file I used, which includes a clickable prototype (click "Prototype" on the right, then press the Play button next to Flow 1 on the first screen). Saved graphic design system information, including fonts and sizes, colors, and grid layouts, can be found there as well.

### Grid Test

Here is a screenshot capturing the homepage's adherence to the grid system referred to in class. For this website, I used a 6x11 grid to allow for versatility in the design while retaining a visible structure.

### Typographic Variations (3)

As for typographic variation, I explored the fonts Roboto, Rubik, and Quicksand because they had a good amount of variation in roundness, angulature, and thickness. Here are those variations:

### Shape Variation (3)

I tested a rounded rectangle shape, as well as an extreme sharp-cornered rectangular shape and a combination of the two to get a good variety of options.

### Color Variation (2)

For colors, I created a light mode and dark mode for my website. I used a cream base on the light mode version to avoid a bright white background, which can cause eye strain and waste screen power. On that variation, I also focused on making the buttons and text pop to make users aware of their options. For the dark mode, I more or less inverted the color scheme of the light mode, with a notable exception being the button colors, which remained dark blue. This was mainly to preserve the darkness of the screen; instead, I made the buttons more noticeable by making the border color white, which has a greater contrast with the background color.

## Accessibility Test

To ensure the accessibility of the website, I tested both the light and dark mode variations with the [Stark](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark) plugin on Figma. As seen below, both color schemes meet both AA and AAA standards by a good margin:
