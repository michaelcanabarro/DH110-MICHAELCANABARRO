## Introduction

Massachusetts' Office of Student Financial Assistance aims, as the name suggests, to provide Massachusetts students with resources pertaining to financial aid for school, with a focus on college. Its website contains links to many grants, scholarships, tuition waivers, and other financial aid programs. Given this information, the website appears to be an extremely valuable resources for students, parents, and schools alike when it comes to financing higher education; however, upon a heuristic evaluation of the site, three main issues stood out as challenging or unsatisfactory:

**1. Error Prevention:** During my heuristic evaluation, I noticed that the use of the search feature took me away from the OFSA website and back to the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education website. Given the aesthetic similarities of the two websites, this may confuse users who don't notice the change as they make the search.

**2.: Visibility of System Status:** The search bar on the webpage does not respond in real time to queries as they are entered; results only appear after the search is completed. A relatively minor issue, but it could make it cumbersome for a user to find what he or she is looking for.

**3. Recognition Rather than Recall:** Finally, I noticed some acronyms on the website that might make it difficult for a first-time or inexperienced user to find a specific program if they only knew it by its full name.

To further assess the severity of these issues, I'll be performing a usability test in which a participant will be asked to complete various tasks, which will be detailed below. Usability testing is a necessary step in the user experience development process because, although expert feedback is important, the users are the ones ultimately using the website, so their ease of use and overall experience are important indicators of what needs to be addressed and how urgently. Through my own usability test, I hope to confirm the severity of the three issues listed above in order to gain a clearer picture of what I should focus on fixing later in the design process.

## Methodology

The test I conducted was designed to evaluate these the issues listed above through the performance of three tasks, each focusing on a different issue. The tasks were as follows:

|Task Number|Task|Tested Heuristic|
|---|---|---|
|1|Initiate a search for "John and Abigail Adams"<br>Comment on the relevance of the first few search results<br>Navigate back to the OSFA homepage|Error Prevention|
|2|Type "financial" into the search field; do not press Enter<br>Press Enter; comment on the accuracy of the results<br>Now search "financial aid" and comment on the quality of these results|Visibility of System Status|
|3|Using the menu bar, navigate to the page for the Police Career Incentive Pay Program|Recognition Rather than Recall|

In terms of logistics, the pilot test was performed in a quiet room (if not quiet, headphones were used), with the participant on I on our personal computers. The test was conducted remotely via Zoom for the comfort of the participant as well as the recording capabilities offered by the program. I began with a quick introduction of myself and the website being studied, as well as the logistics and terms of the test. Before performing the tasks, the participant answered preliminary questions about the website to gauge initial thoughts and impressions. I then walked her through each of the three tasks, paying attention to both the time it took to complete each task as well as the manner in which it was completed (where the participant looked, if she needed help, etc.) in order to assess the problems posed in the introduction. She then answered post-test questions and I ended the recording, after which she completed demographic questions to ensure privacy. Finally, I thanked her for her participation in the study and sent her on her way.
