## Introduction

### Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

My project hopes to support Massachusetts students in their search for college financial aid options. In doing so, I hope to make higher education more accessible by making it easy to find diverse, catered solutions, allowing every student to get the support he or she needs. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

The basic need involved with this activity and aim is the need to be able to locate financial aid resources quickly and efficiently. If these solutions are too difficult to find, many students could be deterred from pursuing higher education, which would be very bad from a state perspective.

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

Currently, possible solutions to satisfy this need include using Google and other Internet searching methods. Additionally, resources exist on many Massachusetts government websites, including the Massachusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA), and private organizations like the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA).

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?

A limitation I have seen is that the resources available to students are both fragmented across multiple webpages and difficult to locate. Digital technology can remedy this issue by facilitating the creation of a comprehensive archive of financial solutions that is flexible enough to allow students to search for resources based on his or her own unique needs.

### Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

The main demographics involved with this activity include high school students (ages ~15-18) and their parents. Specifically, ideal users are students who are planning for college. They might have some familiarity with state government resources and websites, but not a lot; however, the activity does not require any expertise, and my goal is to cater to both extremes (those who know many resources and those who are just starting to look). As for preferences, both students and parents are busy, so they prefer to be able to find information quickly and efficiently so as to not waste a lot of time. Additionally, while younger students are more tech-savvy, their parents prefer services that are easy to use and navigate. 

#### In which context would the users do that activity?

Users would most likely be searching for financial aid solutions in their homes and on a computer rather than a smartphone. They are doing this activity because they do not have the means to pay for college on their own, so they need a solution to help them.

#### What would the users do in order to complete that activity?

Currently, users would likely perform a Google search or, more so in the case of parents, browse Massachusetts government websites, like the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, in the hopes of finding resources.

### Research Method

To gain insights about how my website could be useful to and serve a broad range of users, I conducted a contextual inquiry. Specifically, I interviewed my guest over Zoom because it allowed us to meet conveniently while being as health-conscious as possible. Additionally, Zoom made a great choice because of its recording capabilities, which allowed me to overtly observe and the record the participant, who was made aware of the recording.

During the interview itself, I did not take any notes so as to remain as involved and engaged with the participant as possible. I did, however, record and transcribe the interview to collect a comprehensive account, which I used for my analysis.
