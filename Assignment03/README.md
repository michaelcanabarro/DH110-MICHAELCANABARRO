## Introduction

### Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

My project hopes to support Massachusetts students in their search for college financial aid options. In doing so, I hope to make higher education more accessible by making it easy to find diverse, catered solutions, allowing every student to get the support he or she needs. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

The basic need involved with this activity and aim is the need to be able to locate financial aid resources quickly and efficiently. If these solutions are too difficult to find, many students could be deterred from pursuing higher education, which would be very bad from a state perspective.

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?

Currently, possible solutions to satisfy this need include using Google and other Internet searching methods. Additionally, resources exist on many Massachusetts government websites, including the Massachusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA), and private organizations like the Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (MEFA).

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?

A limitation I have seen is that the resources available to students are both fragmented across multiple webpages and difficult to locate. Digital technology can remedy this issue by facilitating the creation of a comprehensive archive of financial solutions that is flexible enough to allow students to search for resources based on his or her own unique needs.

### Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

The main demographics involved with this activity include high school students (ages ~15-18) and their parents. Specifically, ideal users are students who are planning for college. They might have some familiarity with state government resources and websites, but not a lot; however, the activity does not require any expertise, and my goal is to cater to both extremes (those who know many resources and those who are just starting to look). As for preferences, both students and parents are busy, so they prefer to be able to find information quickly and efficiently so as to not waste a lot of time. Additionally, while younger students are more tech-savvy, their parents prefer services that are easy to use and navigate. 

#### In which context would the users do that activity?

Users would most likely be searching for financial aid solutions in their homes and on a computer rather than a smartphone. They are doing this activity because they do not have the means to pay for college on their own, so they need a solution to help them.

#### What would the users do in order to complete that activity?

Currently, users would likely perform a Google search or, more so in the case of parents, browse Massachusetts government websites, like the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, in the hopes of finding resources.

### Research Method

To gain insights about how my website could be useful to and serve a broad range of users, I conducted a contextual inquiry. Specifically, I interviewed my guest over Zoom because it allowed us to meet conveniently while being as health-conscious as possible. Additionally, Zoom made a great choice because of its recording capabilities, which allowed me to overtly observe and the record the participant, who was made aware of the recording.

During the interview itself, I did not take any notes so as to remain as involved and engaged with the participant as possible. I did, however, record and transcribe the interview to collect a comprehensive account, which I used for my analysis.

### Key Insights and Quotes

#### 1. The user appreciates a wide variety of aid options, especially during an initial, exploratory search

> "Just from browsing quickly here, it feels like they have a variety of different options in one place, which I think is very important. So there's grants, scholarships, tuition waivers, loans... I think that's pretty nice."

#### 2. At the same time, the information needs to be quickly accessible and navigable; the user's initial searches aren't long

> "At least for a quick initial search, \[I'd take] probably thirty minutes, maybe a bit more, just to gather material."

#### 3. Clarity is key for first-time financial aid searchers, especially with regards to the reputability of the website, considering that financial aid is a high-stakes issue

> "I feel like it could be a bit clearer about what this actually is, because obviously it's student financial assistance, but where exactly this is from I feel like \[they] could be a bit more specific. Obviously I did choose Massachusetts financial aid universities and this is what came up, but I feel like the website itself could use a little bit more clarity, just because financial assistance could be for a lot of different things."
> "I feel like a little \[logo at the top of the page] would have been beneficial."
> "Like I mentioned earlier, a lot of students, they're applying for financial aid for the first time, going to university, it's something very big, and it's also a very large commitment. The information should be very clear, very transparent because \[college] is a big financial dedication whether you get financial aid or not."

#### 4. The organization of the content on the website is also crucial; it must be intuitive and facilitate efficient searching by users

> "Espscially if students are applying to university for the first time, it can be a little overwhelming if it's the first time they're engaging with this type of content, so having a clear website or making sure all the information is laid out correctly and functioning will help their financial aid research."

#### 5. Students can benefit from being eased into search topics and finding resources with questions

> "Something I would add would be like frequently asked questions, you know, like basic things like "What is financial aid?" "Where can I get financial aid?" "Do people qualify for financial aid?" and it also links back to all these different resources on the website would be good, because for students, I feel like sometimes they don't know what they don't know, and by having these questions, it's... a guide to help them figure out what they need. It's almost like when a teacher asks us a question to guide us to thinking the right things."

## Reflection

Overall, the contextual inquiry process was very enlightening and useful for me. Going in, I had my own preconceived notions of what a "good" website would be, given my short experience in User Experience and Design thus far. However, after performing contextual inquiry, it was fascinating to see from the perspective of someone who might use the website I'm trying to design. The participant I chose gave thorough, insightful answers that can easily be used to inform design decisions for the final product. However, I personally found it a bit difficult to stick to my guide, as inevitable conversation can wander. At points, it felt like I was preventing a more natural conversation from developing to stick to the script. This may have been due to my interviewing style or the choices of questions in my guide, but in any case it's something I will look to improve for future iterations. But, overall, this experience was extremely beneficial for me; it taught me the importance of staying in touch with users, as well as understanding their needs and wants, to design the best possible product.
