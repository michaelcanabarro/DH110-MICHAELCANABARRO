## Assignment 07: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Introduction

In the assignments building up to this stage, I assembled all of the necessary information and feedback to create a viable prototype for my website. Now, for this assignment, I will be creating the first functional prototype of my app, implementing the design suggestions made in [Assignment 06](https://github.com/michaelcanabarro/DH110-MICHAELCANABARRO/blob/main/Assignment06/README.md). As one of the last stages in the design process, this will give me the best-possible look and feel for how the app will work. Because of this, it will allow me to test its functionality with others, which I will do in the form of a cognitive walkthrough. From this test, I hope to get some relatively final feedback so that I can perfect the design in any way necessary before I publish the complete version

## Interactive Prototype

Here is the link to the Figma file for my [interactive prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/SYk9wIRYr2TM25RjYTKT0J/A07_InteractivePrototype). To use it, click on the black "play" button at the top-right corner of the screen.

*Disclaimer: This prototype does not support every possible combination of actions seen on the screen.* It supports the following actions:

**Task 1: Finding scholarships with menu and buttons**

- Finding scholarships with the menu and other buttons
- Toggling between any combination of quick-view mode (allows you to view more information at a glance) and showing eligible options (according to information entered by users on their accounts; accounts are not supported by this prototype currently)
- Sorting scholarships by descending dollar amount (due to time constraints, I could not implement every feature of the sort dropdown)
- Applying dollar amount and deadline filters to scholarships (again due to time constraints, sorting and filters can only be applied after toggling both quick-view mode and eligible options, and sorting must be applied first)

**Task 2: Finding scholarships using the search bar feature**

- Using the search bar to search "financial aid"
- Applying the same sort and filter features mentioned above, but with an added "type" distinction, where scholarships can be selected (again, sorting must be applied before filters in this prototype)
- Clicking on the John and Abigail Adams scholarship, both in and out of quick-view mode, to find more information

Both tasks start at the homepage (1st screen) and end at the full-screen page for the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship.

## Wireflow with Interface Design

Here is the link to the Figma file for my [wireflow](https://www.figma.com/file/zj76GQX7aLTkRO0TeGNe4C/A07_Wireflow), and images are provided below. The wireflow is not intended to be used interactively, but rather as a map for each task. It contains arrows indicating the progression for each task; Task 1 is in green, and Task 2 is in blue. I used the [Autoflow](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733902567457592893/Autoflow) plugin to create these wireflows.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

Before finding participants for my cognitive walkthrough, I actually altered my prototype based on the feedback I got during my in-class impression test and cognitive walkthrough, which was done on my [previous version](https://www.figma.com/file/5E9fUXyux4GbmlvOCSaLfL/A06_Digitized_Wireflows?node-id=0%3A1). I made it more clear on the homepage what MA FA Hub's function was, reworded the "Getting Started" button (a peer said it was difficult to determine if that meant getting started with financial aid or not), and added sort and filter features for the button-navigated portion of the site in addition to the search bar, which my testers said would be more convenient.
