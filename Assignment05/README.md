## Assignment 05: Wireframes & Low-Fidelity Prototype Testing

## Introduction

In Assignments 1-4, I have laid the theoretical foundation for my website and gotten a better idea of who will be using it. Now, through creating low-fidelity prototypes, I will be able to see my vision materialized on paper. Prototyping and wireframing are a crucial parts of the design process; they allow designers to get an idea of how their product will actually look once it is made, which can shed light on things that work well and those that need to be tweaked, without the large amounts of time and resources that go into a full-blown prototype. From my wireframes, I will develop full wireflows to better visualize what performing a task looks like on my website. Finally, I will test my wireflow with a user to gain insights on what works well and what doesn't from the user's perspective. After all, the website is being designed for the users, so their input is very important to develop the best possible final product. Through these exercises, I hope to establish the structure of my website so that it's ready for the aesthetic touches I will apply later on.

## Wireframes & Wireflows

Below are the wireflows I created for use in my user testing. It details the entire system, which encompasses the following two tasks:

Task 1: Browsing Options with Quick View Mode (starts with clicking on Menu icon)

Task 2: Narrowing Search with Selective Filters (starts with clicking on Search bar)

## Testing

I conducted my test over Zoom. Throughout the test, I shared a window containing only one frame of the system (shown below), so as to mimic the feel of navigating on a phone and prevent the tester from being able to peek at the other screens, which might influence him. I had him tell me what he wanted to click, and navigated the system as suggested by my wireflow, which I had pulled up for myself to see.

The participant asked that I did not record him, so I did not. However, I plotted his navigation for both both tasks and wrote down any interesting or surprising observations, which are shown below. Also shown are details about the two tasks I gave my participant. I read the whole task at the start of the test, and only reminded him of what to do if he forgot or got stuck.

### Task 1 (Orange)
- Navigate to Scholarships
- Use Quick View Mode to narrow your results
- Learn more about Scholarship 2 and apply

### Task 2 (Blue)
- Search for "financial aid"
- Sort results by dollar amount, highest to lowest
- Apply filters for dollar amount ($5,000-$10,000), financial aid type (scholarship), and deadline range (1/1/22-1/15/22)
- Learn more about Scholarship 2 and apply

## Reflection

For the most part, the test went extremely smoothly; the participant was able to complete both tasks without too much difficulty. Still, there were a few things that happened that I did not expect before the test started:
- For the first task, the participant started by clicking directly on the "Scholarships" button, rather than navigating through the menu. In hindsight, this isn't such a bad thing; it reduces the amount of steps needed to produce the same result and is therefore a good design feature in my eyes.
- During the second task, when prompted to apply filters, the participant initially sought to click on the "Sort" dropdown again, which caught me by surprise. Even after reminding him to "apply a filter," he tried to click on "Sort" again; only at the third time of asking did he find the "Filter" button. To be fair, he did realize this is what he should have done, and wondered how he didn't notice it in the first place. But, this does indicate a potential design flaw. If I were to revise the prototype, I would address this hiccup by making the "Filter" and "Sort" buttons prominent, perhaps with a different color from the rest of the screen or applying a shadow effect to mimic a 3D button. I also will reconsider the words used for each button, as "sort" and "filter" have similar meanings that could be confused if read the wrong way. 
- When selecting a date for the deadline range in Task 2, the participant initially looked to type a date before realizing that he could select a date on the calendar. Perhaps my calendar interfaced resembled a keyboard, but I will be sure to make it visually distinct in future iterations. However, he was able to notice that he needed to select the calendar icon below the end date, which was a positive indication of the design of that page.

Overall, the process of prototype testing was very enlightening; it brought my attention to potential issues that I could not have foreseen on my own. Along with the past assignments, it again reminded me of the importanct of user feedback at all stages of the process, even though my design is technically becoming more fleshed-out. Going forward, I will continue to seek this feedback and make appropriate changes to my design to ensure the best possible end product.
