## Introduction

In Assignments 1-4, I have laid the theoretical foundation for my website and gotten a better idea of who will be using it. Now, through creating low-fidelity prototypes, I will be able to see my vision materialized on paper. Prototyping and wireframing are a crucial parts of the design process; they allow designers to get an idea of how their product will actually look once it is made, which can shed light on things that work well and those that need to be tweaked. From my wireframes, I will develop full wireflows to better visualize what performing a task looks like on my website. Finally, I will test my wireflow with a user to gain insights on what works well and what doesn't from the user's perspective. After all, the website is being designed for the users, so their input is very important to develop the best possible final product. Through these exercises, I hope to establish the structure of my website so that it's ready for the aesthetic touches I will apply later on.
