# Designing a Financial Aid App for Massachusetts Students

### Introduction

This project is centered around designing an app that Massachusetts students could use for all of their financial aid needs. As college and university tuition rates continue to increase, financial aid is becoming even more important than ever. This is especially true with regards to the accessibility of higher education; for many, financial aid is the difference between attending one's dream school or not. Because of this, I wanted to design an application that streamlined the financial aid search process while being flexible enough to cater to a diverse student body. At the same time, because older family members and guardians may help their children search for and apply to financial aid, I sought to make the app straightforward enough to fulfill the wants and needs of both young and old users. After looking at competitors, conducting many rounds of research and tests, and designing several prototypes, the result was MA FA Hub, an all-in-one app to meet Massachusetts students' every financial aid need. With MA FA Hub, I hope to provide a solution that makes higher education more accessible for everyone.

### Design Statement

The goal of this design project is to create a website that makes the task of researching and finding financial aid resources easier and more efficient for students who need it. By making it easier to locate financial aid, I hope to increase students' chances of being able to attend the schools of their dreams, making higher education more accessible.

### Competitor Analysis

To get a better idea of how existing financial aid websites work as well as the websites that would be competing with MA FA Hub, I evaluated the websites of the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA) and Massachusetts Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) using [Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). While both websites were by no means bad, they had elements that were cumbersome, unfamiliar or both, which limited their accessibility-- in the case of financial aid, this inaccessibility could be the difference between attending or not attending a particular school.

With potential areas for improvement narrowed down, I conducted a pilot usability test to see from a user's perspective. During the test, I had a participant perform a handful of tasks with the OSFA website in the hopes of illuminating problematic areas that I had missed. Exactly that happened; my participant had a few hiccups that I did not expect, which pinpointed parts of the website that needed streamlining. As I learned in this step, user feedback is crucial to a successful design project, which ended up being a common thread as I developed my app. [Read more...](https://github.com/michaelcanabarro/DH110-MICHAELCANABARRO/blob/main/Assignment02/README.md)

### User Research

To gain a deeper understanding of users' opinions of existing websites, I conducted user research by interviewing a member of my target population. During the interview, I gave her general tasks to do on the Massachusetts OSFA website, asking her questions about her choices throughout. From her responses, I got a lot of useful insights. Specifically, she emphasized ease of navigation, efficient organization of content, and clarity of the website's reputability, all of which I sought to implement in my design.

###  UX Storytelling

To further my understanding of my target users, I created two personas of potential users of MA FA Hub: a student and a parent. By envisioning their wants, needs, and feelings, as well as how and why they would use MA FA Hub, I was forced to broaden my perspective of my app's target audience and detach my biases from my work, both of which were very valuable. These exercises also helped me to solidify features that could help my users achieve their goals: Quick-View Mode and Selective Filters.

### Wireframes 

With the theoretical framework of my app in place along with a comprehensive understanding of my users' behavior, I drew simple wireframes to get an initial idea of how the app would look on-screen. Through this exercise, I gained a much richer understanding of how my app would be able to help my target audience through its design.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype and Graphic Design Element Variation

From the wireframes I created, I developed a wireflow for the app by connecting the frames with arrows to illustrate the various ways in which it can be navigated. I again recruited a potential user to test this low-fidelity prototype, where fortunately I found minimal issues. However, the prototype wasn't perfect, and the user's feedback was valuable for highlighting small but important areas for modification.

After testing my low-fidelity prototype, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create interface designs for MA FA Hub. Through this process, I was able to get a clear picture of how my app would look on an actual device. At this point, I also made sure to test different variations in the elements of the screens, from typography and color variation to the shapes of the app's buttons. Each variation was tested with a potential user to see which one left the best impression. From this round of feedback, I was able to solidify the font, colors, and button shape that I would stick with for the final design.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

Finally, I had all the information needed to assemble a functional prototype of my app. Again using Figma, I implemented attachment flows between the various screens of my interface design to create a high-fidelity prototype, the final version of which is embedded below.

After creating the prototype, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with a user to see how well users were able to navigate the interface. To my delight, the user was able to complete the tasks I gave her with ease. [Read more...](https://github.com/michaelcanabarro/DH110-MICHAELCANABARRO/blob/main/Assignment07/README.md)

(*Note: I have modified the high-fidelity prototype since creating the GitHub page linked above in order to reflect suggestions made by Professor Sookie Cho. Since these changes were made on the same Figma file, the file linked in Assignment 7 does not match the screenshots shown on the page exactly.*)
